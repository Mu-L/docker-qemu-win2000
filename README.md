## Start an instance
```sh
docker run --detach \
  --name qemu-win2000 \
  --device /dev/kvm \
  --publish 127.0.0.1:3389:3389/tcp \
  --publish 127.0.0.1:5900:5900/tcp \
  --publish 127.0.0.1:6080:6080/tcp \
  docker.io/hectorm/qemu-win2000:latest
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `--device /dev/kvm` option can only be used on Linux hosts, it can be removed on Windows and macOS hosts at a significant performance penalty.

The instance can be accessed from:
 * **RDP** (`3389/TCP`), user `Administrator`, password `password`.
 * **VNC** (`5900/TCP`), without password.
 * **noVNC** (`6080/TCP`), http://127.0.0.1:6080/vnc.html
 * `docker exec -it qemu-win2000 vmshell`

Additionally the contents of the `/mnt/` directory in the container will be exposed on the `Z:` drive via SMB.
